 I received my B.A. in Economics (minor in Mathematics) and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of New Mexico. I am currently<br> 
 in my 2nd year of the University of Arizona's Computer Science PhD program. My advisor is <a href="http://kobus.ca/">Dr. Kobus Barnard</a>. My research interests include<br>
 graph theory, graph drawing, combinatorial optimization, computer vision algorithms and image processing.<br>

      <h3>Stereo Gaze</h3>
    This project deals with the development and testing of a Bayesian model for temporal scene inference. Given a video of a scene with people and objects the goal is to infer people's locations, their head pose, and also the locations of interesting objects in the scene.<br>

      <h3>Bipartite Graph Drawing</h3> 
      My previous research has dealt with various bipartite graph drawing problems. In the most traditional case the goal is to position the nodes of the bipartition on parallel layers in such a way that the total number of edge crossings is minimized.
    Problems that I've explored also include weighted and so-called bottleneck variants of bipartite crossing minimizationl. <br>
